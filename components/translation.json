I like C++ very much, but have not been coding in C++ for so long since entering university that it is hard for me to develop a project in C++ now...",
            "java": "A widely used language exclaiming to be better than C++. I do not know very well about JVM, but I think it is quite strong. The programming style fascinates me a lot, and I prefer to use Java to develop a non-script software at present. I used Eclipse Java during my internship, but I do prefer to use text editor + terminal for personal projects (cannot get used to IDE anyway, personally).",
            "scala": "A scalable language developed based on Java, but the style is somehow quite similar to Elm and Python. I came to know about Scala from Apache Spark packages and I believe Scala can be a quite powerful tool in machine learning other than Python. I only know about general grammar at present and have written a small web backend with PlayFramework.",
            "python": "Very convenient script and machine learning tool. It takes no time to write a Python script, so I often use it when I am lazy enough. I am currently studying machine learning in Python, but I do not like it quite much since Python's performance is so poor and also too hard to maintain as a big project. I hope that Python can be replaced one day, honestly.",
            "riscv": "Learnt as a meta language in some college course. Assembly is interesting, yet too difficult to actually code on. May also want to learn about x86-64 Assembly, not knowing why and what to use for.",
            "verilog": "A hardware description language. Quite convenient to use, but also drives one mad on some timing problems. Once in a period I liked hardware coding a lot, however, I am not planning to work more with it in the future.",
            "vb": "An out-dated user interface design tool. I suppose that no one will use it nowadays... And I learnt it quite a couple of years ago to produce many small programs that I cannot find them today. What I do remember is that IDE will alert you a syntax error if accidently leaving a line without completing it :)",
            "javascript": "A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. But still, I do not like building environments overall, so I preferred to write pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future.",

I bought both CD and Steam version for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games. Although I also played the new games as soon as they are released, I do not think they are better than those before, so gradually I stopped playing Touhou anymore...",
            "ifs2l0l0p2": "My favorite Touhou character is Remilia Scarlet, and that's where my name Remisiki came from. Vampire is good!",
            "ifs2l0l1p0": "Started playing CAVE games since 2019. At first, I could only play them on PC simulators with keyboard; Then in 2020 I bought a joystick controller so that I could practice CAVE at home, which helped me a lot when I actually go to Rekka Game Center in Shanghai to play on real arcade machines.",
            "ifs2l0l1p1": "Favorite CAVE game is Dodonpachi Daioujou, and favorite music is 『Stage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-審判の日』. I do not own a PS4/Xbox 360, so I can only buy a few of CAVE games at present, sadly; Hope that more CAVE games can be tranplanted to Steam in recent years.",
            "ifs2l1l0p0": "Hollow Knight is my first Metroroidvania game. I started playing it since late 2019 (expecting Silksong to be released soon), and have spent around 1,000 hours on it until now. Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with plentiful contents and excellent operation experience; Later I mainly ran on Randomizer MOD and Any% Speedrun, but now I have decided to stop playing it until Silksong is released (hope it will).",
            "ifs2l1l1p0": "Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroroidvania game. I first played it's early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.",
            "ifs2l1l1p1": "It seems that not so many Metroroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attentions than now.",
            "ifs2l1l2p0": "Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.",
            "ifs2l2l0p0": "Steins;Gate is one of the best game I've ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one's own though.",
            "ifs2l2l0p1": "Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set 『GATE OF STINER -Piano-』 as my ringtone!",
            "ifs2l2l1p0": "Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.",
            "ifs2l2l1p1": "As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.",
            "ifs2l2l1p2": "The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.",
            "ifs2l2l2p0": "I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroroidvania elements other than riddle solving.",
            "ifs2l2l2p1": "This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.",
            "ifs2l3l0p0": "Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.",
            "ifs2l3l0p1": "The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.",
            "ifs2l3l0p2": "Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven't!",
            "ifs2l3l1p0": "Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.",
            "ifs2l3l2p0": "Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.",

I bought both CD and Steam version for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games. Although I also played the new games as soon as they are released, I do not think they are better than those before, so gradually I stopped playing Touhou anymore...",

At first, I could only play them on PC simulators with keyboard; Then in 2020 I bought a joystick controller so that I could practice CAVE at home, which helped me a lot when I actually go to Rekka Game Center in Shanghai to play on real arcade machines.",
            "ifs2l0l1p1": "Favorite CAVE game is Dodonpachi Daioujou, and favorite music is 『Stage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-審判の日』. I do not own a PS4/Xbox 360, so I can only buy a few of CAVE games at present, sadly; Hope that more CAVE games can be tranplanted to Steam in recent years.",
            "ifs2l1l0p0": "Hollow Knight is my first Metroroidvania game. I started playing it since late 2019 (expecting Silksong to be released soon), and have spent around 1,000 hours on it until now. Hollow Knight is a wonderful game with plentiful contents and excellent operation experience; Later I mainly ran on Randomizer MOD and Any% Speedrun, but now I have decided to stop playing it until Silksong is released (hope it will).",
            "ifs2l1l1p0": "Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroroidvania game. I first played it's early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.",
            "ifs2l1l1p1": "It seems that not so many Metroroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attentions than now.",
            "ifs2l1l2p0": "Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.",
            "ifs2l2l0p0": "Steins;Gate is one of the best game I've ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one's own though.",
            "ifs2l2l0p1": "Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set 『GATE OF STINER -Piano-』 as my ringtone!",
            "ifs2l2l1p0": "Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.",
            "ifs2l2l1p1": "As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.",
            "ifs2l2l1p2": "The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.",
            "ifs2l2l2p0": "I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroroidvania elements other than riddle solving.",
            "ifs2l2l2p1": "This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.",
            "ifs2l3l0p0": "Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.",
            "ifs2l3l0p1": "The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.",
            "ifs2l3l0p2": "Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven't!",
            "ifs2l3l1p0": "Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.",
            "ifs2l3l2p0": "Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.",
