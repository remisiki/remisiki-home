            "pascal": "最初のプログラミング言語です。ずいぶん前の話ですが、よく使うIDEはTurbo PascalとFree Pascalでした。青いバックグラウンド上で白いコードのようなレトロなプログラミング環境はめっちゃ印象に残った。いくつかのPascalコンテストに参加した経験があって、毎回も自分でソートを書くのが嫌なんだからその後はC++に切り替えました。",
            "cpp": "高校時代のメインプログラミング言語です。GoogleやStackOverflowの使い方が知らない時期でどうやってC++を独学したのか自分でもわからないです。最初はDev-CPPを使っていたが、後でテキストエディター＋ターミナルになりました。大学に入学したから長い間にC++でコーディングしたことがほとんどないし今やってもちょっと厳しいかも。",
            "java": "C++より強く汎用性の高い言語だと言われているみたい。JVMはよくわからないが結構強いと思います。Javaのスタイルはめっちゃ気に入るからスクリプト以外のソフトウェアを開発するならJavaが一択かもしれん。インターンでEclipseを使ったことがあるんだけど、やっぱりテキストエディター＋ターミナルのほうが好きです。",
            "scala": "Javaをベースにして開発されたスケーラブル言語だと言われますが、コードスタイルはPythonやElmにそっくり。Apache Sparkを調べたときScalaに興味が沸いて、ScalaがきっといつかPythonを越えてすごい強力な機械学習ツールになれるだと信じています。ただいまは基礎の知識しか持っていないですが、最近はPlayFrameworkでシンプルなウェブバックエンドを書きました。",
            "python": "すごく使いやすいスクリプト言語と機械学習ツールである。Pythonのライブラリーが便利すぎてサボりたいときは常に使ってしまう。今は機械学習やデーター分析を学んでおり、Pythonの低スペックと大きなプロジェクトとしてのメンテナンスの難しさがわかりみ。いつかPythonが置き換えられるようにお祈りします、本気で。",

            "vb": "古いUIデザインツールです。世の中にはもう誰も使っていないだろうか…何年前に数個のミニプログラムを作ったのにもう見つからないです。もしVisual BasicのIDEで文を完了せずに他のところに間違えて移動したらは常にシンタクスエラーのメッセージボックスが出てるのは結構困りますよね。",
            "javascript": "強力なフロントエンド言語です。JavaScriptを知った前はElm.jsに触ったことがある（多分誰も聞いたこともないライブラリー）。Elmの特徴は関数型、すなわちすべてのタイプが関数のようなパイプラインで渡しています。環境構築はめんどいからJavaScript＋HTML＋CSSだけでウェブページを書き出したこともある。最近はReact.jsにめっちゃハマってるけど、静的なウェブページしか作りません。Reactは非常に便利なライブラリーであって、試してみたい機能もたくさんあります。",

            "ifs2l0l1p1": "一番好きなケイブゲームは『怒首領蜂大往生』、BGMは『Stage 5: EVAC INDUSTRY-審判の日』。PS4/Xbox 360を持っていないから買えるゲームは限られているのでもっとケイブのゲームをSteamに移植してほしい。",
            "ifs2l1l0p0": "ホロウナイトはメトロイドヴァニア初体験です。2019年のとき続編がすぐ出てきそうなのでホロウナイトを買った、そしておよそ1000時間プレイした。ホロウナイトはストーリー性が素晴らしくて操作も気持ちいいですし、おすすめの神ゲーです。SilksongがリリースされるまではランダマイザーとAny％スピードランをやっています。",
            "ifs2l1l1p0": "エンダーリリーズは二番目に好きなメトロイドヴァニアです。初プレイは2021年の早期アクセスでしたが、すでにエンリリを気に入った。ストーリーはすごくいいけど短いのでクリアしてからもっと遊びたいです。DLCとかが出たら新しいマップとコンテンツがあったらうれしいです。今はランダマイザーと100％マップのスピードランをやっています。",
            "ifs2l1l1p1": "エンリリはあまり人気がないらしいので、今よりもっと注目されるべきだと思います。",
            "ifs2l1l2p0": "Ori 1をプレイし始めたばかり、今は停止中です。ホロウナイトとエンリリよりも難しいゲームだと思います。いろんなスキルはおもしろいですけど。",
            "ifs2l2l0p0": "シュタゲは今までプレイした最強な神ゲーだと言っても言い過ぎないです。プレイ時間はおよそ50時間でしたが全トロフィーまではまだ遠いです。攻略がなかったら真エンドにたどり着くのは結構難しいと思うし、セーブスロットも全然足りないですね。",
            "ifs2l2l0p1": "推しキャラはフェイリス・ニャンニャンです。フェイリスとの思いを犠牲にしなきゃゲームが進まないのは本当に泣ける…BGMも素敵だし今でも全部覚えてる。ちなみに、自分はスマホの着信音を『GATE OF STINER -Piano-』に設定しています＾＿＾",
            "ifs2l2l1p0": "Steins;Gate 0はSteins;Gateの続編よりもっと前編みたいなもんです。本編のシュタインズ・ゲート線に到達するためにゼロ編は不可欠なのでシュタゲを理解したいならゼロ編もプレイすべきです。",
            "ifs2l2l1p1": "ゲーム自身は本編に負けない神ゲーですし、真エンディングルートもより複雑で他のルートと強く結びついている。",
            "ifs2l2l1p2": "音楽とBGMが時々に本編のアレンジバージョンになるのは最高過ぎますよね。『Reawake』が出るまですごい待ってたんだ。",
            "ifs2l2l2p0": "ホタルノニッキをプレイするきっかけはエンリリに見た目がそっくりな（かわいい）主人公です。謎解きゲームよりメトロイドヴァニアの要素も若干あるんだと思います。",
            "ifs2l2l2p1": "ゲーム難易度は高すぎます。マウス操作がシビア過ぎて特定のトロフィーが全然取れなかった。それにしてもホタルノニッキは間違いなく神ゲーだし、今度は日本一ソフトの別のゲームも試してみたいと思います。",
            "ifs2l3l0p0": "シュタゲのゲームをプレイする前にすでに心の中でトップワンのアニメになっていました。ゲームの全ルートをクリアした後アニメ二周目を観たらそれをもっと確信しました。",
            "ifs2l3l0p1": "一番感動したシーンは本編でオカリンは牧瀬氏を救うために自分を刺したとき、そしてゼロ編でオカリンは目覚めシーンで『うあはぁはぁはぁはぁー』と二分間くらい笑いつづけたときでした。",
            "ifs2l3l0p2": "科学的なコンテンツは無茶な気がしますが作品全体は今までプレイしたタイムトラベル系の中で一番合理的です。とりあえずおすすめですので、まだ観てない方はぜひ観てみよう！",
            "ifs2l3l1p0": "サイコパスは犯罪心理を描く、深く考えさせられる近未来設定の作品です。一期の原案や脚本の虚淵玄さんはさすがに強すぎて、二期の評価が低いし一期とは大きく異なり違和感しかない。三期の新しい発想は面白いから次はどうなるのかめっちゃ気になる。",
            "ifs2l3l2p0": "物語シリーズは怪異について物語です。みんなが怪異に描かれていますが、その怪異の本体は様々な人間性を表していると思います。原作の小説は十分興味深いですし、新房昭之風のアニメもめっちゃ印象に残ります。物語シリーズはアニメが原作を超えた珍しいタイプですね。",

Memory allocation is quite tough to use, yet later finding it quite useful since no modern high level languages (except Rust maybe) can manage memory so directly.

Used to use Turbo Pascal and Free Pascal as my IDE, and I still remember the blue background and some keyboard shortcuts which reminds me of the old-school programming style. I attended several programming matches in Pascal, but later turned to C++ instead since I do not want to write sort by hand every time :)",
            "cpp": "Used as the main programming language in my high school days, though I cannot believe that I learnt it all on my own without Google or StackOverflow. Used to use Dev-CPP as IDE, but turned to text editor + terminal later. I have not been coding in C++ for so long since entering university that it is hard for me to develop a project in C++ now...",

The programming style fascinates me a lot, and I prefer to use Java to develop a non-script software at present. I used Eclipse Java during my internship, but I do prefer to use text editor + terminal for personal projects (cannot get used to IDE anyway, personally).",
            "scala": "A scalable language developed based on Java, but the style is somehow quite similar to Elm and Python. I came to know about Scala from Apache Spark packages and I believe Scala can be a quite powerful tool in machine learning other than Python. I only know about general grammar at present and have written a small web backend with PlayFramework.",
            "python": "Very convenient script and machine learning tool. It takes no time to write a Python script, so I often use it when I am lazy enough.

            "vb": "An out-dated user interface design tool. I suppose that no one will use it nowadays... And I learnt it quite a couple of years ago to produce many small programs that I cannot find them today. What I do remember is that IDE will alert you a syntax error if accidently leaving a line without completing it :)",
            "javascript": "A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. But still, I do not like building environments overall, so I preferred to write pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future.",

I bought both CD and Steam version (except TH06) for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games.

            "ifs2l1l1p0": "Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroidvania game. I first played it's early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.",
            "ifs2l1l1p1": "It seems that not so many Metroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attention than now.",
            "ifs2l1l2p0": "Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.",
            "ifs2l2l0p0": "Steins;Gate is one of the best game I've ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements. I think it is quite hard to reach the true ending without viewing strategy guides, and the saving slots are not enough to do it all on one's own though.",
            "ifs2l2l0p1": "Favorite character is Faris NyanNyan, cried a lot when sacrificing her to reach other ends :( Besides, music is very good and I can recall all of them clearly; I even set 『GATE OF STINER -Piano-』 as my ringtone!",
            "ifs2l2l1p0": "Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.",
            "ifs2l2l1p1": "As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.",
            "ifs2l2l1p2": "The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.",
            "ifs2l2l2p0": "I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroidvania elements other than riddle solving.",
            "ifs2l2l2p1": "This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.",
            "ifs2l3l0p0": "Steins;Gate is already my favorite Anime before playing the games, and I like it even more after rewatching it with all game routes cleared.",
            "ifs2l3l0p1": "The most touching scene in Steins;Gate is that Okarin stabbed himself when trying to save Makise, and in Steins;Gate 0 is that Okarin reawaked and laughed UAHAHAHAHA for two minutes.",
            "ifs2l3l0p2": "Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven't!",
            "ifs2l3l1p0": "Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.",
            "ifs2l3l2p0": "Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.",

Used to use Dev-CPP as IDE, but turned to text editor + terminal later. I have not been coding in C++ for so long since entering university that it is hard for me to develop a project in C++ now...",

The programming style fascinates me a lot, and I prefer to use Java to develop a non-script software at present. I used Eclipse Java during my internship, but I do prefer to use text editor + terminal for personal projects (cannot get used to IDE anyway, personally).",
            "scala": "A scalable language developed based on Java, but the style is somehow quite similar to Elm and Python. I came to know about Scala from Apache Spark packages and I believe Scala can be a quite powerful tool in machine learning other than Python. I only know about general grammar at present and have written a small web backend with PlayFramework.",

            "javascript": "A powerful frontend language. I first got to know JavaScript when taking a course that taught Elm.js, a language that nobody should have known about. Elm is a functional programming language, and I find it quite fresh to write functions in a pipeline style. But still, I do not like building environments overall, so I preferred to write pure JavaScript with HTML and CSS before using React.js. React is convenient, and there appears to be quite many things for me to dig in web design. I can only write simple static webpages right now, and may want to learn more about dynamic ones in the future.",

I bought both CD and Steam version (except TH06) for these three games, and I think their game content and music are among the best of all Touhou games.

            "ifs2l1l1p0": "Ender Lilies is my second favorite Metroidvania game. I first played it's early access on 2021 and liked it quite much. The story is excellent but too short... I would be very satisfied if the game had been developed into a bigger one so that I could spend more time in it. Currently I run Randomizer MOD and 100% Map Speedrun for Ender Lilies.",
            "ifs2l1l1p1": "It seems that not so many Metroidvania players know about Ender Lilies, and I think it should receive more attention than now.",
            "ifs2l1l2p0": "Just started playing Ori 1, and currently stopping for perhaps several months. I think it is more difficult than Hollow Knight or Ender Lilies, and some new moving skills are quite cool. Yes, a hard game.",
            "ifs2l2l0p0": "Steins;Gate is one of the best game I've ever played. Already spent 50 hours on it, but still far from all achievements.

            "ifs2l2l1p0": "Steins;Gate 0 can be seen as a sequel or Part 0 of Steins;Gate. But I think they should be combined together to construct a complete story, since Steins;Gate 0 is necessary to reach Steins;Gate.",
            "ifs2l2l1p1": "As a game itself, I think Steins;Gate 0 is really wonderful and does not lose to Steins;Gate. The true ending route is more interesting and strongly connected to other routes, so all routes are important to understand the whole story.",
            "ifs2l2l1p2": "The music is undoubtedly excellent, sometimes rearranging with Steins;Gate. Waiting for so long before the Reawake appears though.",
            "ifs2l2l2p0": "I played htoL#NiQ mainly because the girl in this game is really similar to that in Ender Lilies (cute) and there are some Metroidvania elements other than riddle solving.",
            "ifs2l2l2p1": "This game is extremely hard. I still cannot complete the last several achievements, and the mouse operation is so tough for me. Despite the difficulty, it is a wonderful game and I would also like to try other Nipponichi games in the future.",

            "ifs2l3l0p2": "Although the science part of Steins;Gate is very simple and makes no sense, the works itself is in fact the best among all time travelling fictions I have ever watched. I strongly recommend watching Steins;Gate if anyone haven't!",
            "ifs2l3l1p0": "Psychopass is a Cyberpunk Anime about criminals, and it gives me lots of deep thoughts that I have never seen elsewhere. The first season of Psychopass is written by Urobuchi Gen, which I think is far better than the sequels. The second season is obviously a little disappointing, but the third season brings some new ideas and is very interesting. I am very curious about what stories will be like next.",
            "ifs2l3l2p0": "Monogatari series are about mysteries. The author made everyone into a Kaii so as to talk about humanities. The novels are already interesting enough, yet I was more deeply impressed by the Anime version developed by Sinbou Akiyuki. To be frank, I have never expected an Anime to go beyond its original work, except for Monogatari.",
